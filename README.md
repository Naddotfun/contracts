## System Overview

Nad.Pump is a smart contract system for creating and managing bonding curve-based tokens. It enables creators to mint new tokens with associated bonding curves and allows traders to buy and sell these tokens through a centralized endpoint. The system uses a combination of bonding curves and automated market makers to provide liquidity and price discovery for newly created tokens.

## Contract Architecture

### Bonding Curve
