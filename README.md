## System Overview

Nad.Pump is a smart contract system for creating and managing bonding curve-based tokens. It enables creators to mint new tokens with associated bonding curves and allows traders to buy and sell these tokens through a centralized endpoint. The system uses a combination of bonding curves and automated market makers to provide liquidity and price discovery for newly created tokens.

## Contract Architecture

### Bonding Curve

### Mint Party

### Core Contracts

1. **Core.sol**

   - Central contract that coordinates all system operations
   - Handles token creation, buying, and selling operations
   - Manages interactions with WNAD and fee collection
   - Implements various safety checks and slippage protection

2. **BondingCurve.sol**

   - Implements the bonding curve logic
   - Calculates token prices based on supply
   - Manages token reserves and liquidity

3. **BondingCurveFactory.sol**

   - Deploys new bonding curve contracts
   - Maintains registry of created curves
   - Ensures standardization of curve parameters

4. **WNAD.sol**
   - Wrapped NAD token implementation
   - Provides ERC20 interface for NAD
   - Enables advanced trading features

### Supporting Contracts

5. **FeeVault.sol**

   - Collects and manages trading fees
   - Implements ERC4626 for fee distribution
   - Provides revenue sharing mechanism

6. **Token.sol**

   - Standard ERC20 implementation for created tokens
   - Includes additional features for bonding curve integration

7. **MintParty.sol & MintPartyFactory.sol**
   - Manages collective minting operations
   - Coordinates group participation in token creation

### Utility Contracts

- **Utils/**

  - Contains helper functions and libraries
  - Implements common mathematical operations
  - Provides security utilities

- **Interfaces/**

  - Defines contract interfaces
  - Ensures proper contract interaction
  - Facilitates upgradability

- **Errors/**
  - Centralizes error definitions
  - Provides clear error messages
  - Improves debugging experience
